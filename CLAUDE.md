# MovieSwiftUI — Project Guidelines

## Delivery workflow — every issue and feature follows this

Each fix or feature goes through the same pipeline. Do not push
directly to `main`, and do not skip steps even for small changes.

1. **Branch.** Cut a feature branch off the latest `main`
   (`fix/…`, `feat/…`, `refactor/…`, `docs/…`, `chore/…`). Never
   commit to `main` directly.
2. **TDD.** Build the change test-first per the red → green →
   refactor cycle below. The test and the code it satisfies land in
   the **same commit**.
3. **Lint & format.** Run `./scripts/format.sh` (or `swiftformat`
   on touched files) and `./scripts/lint.sh --fix` before staging —
   see "Lint & format before every commit".
4. **Open a PR.** Push the branch and open a pull request with `gh`
   (always the GitHub CLI, never the web UI). The PR description
   states what changed, why, and how it was tested.
5. **Green CI.** Wait for every required check to pass
   (`swiftlint`, the Analyze/CodeQL jobs, and the
   ios/ios-ipad/mac/tvos/package test suites). Never merge a PR with
   pending or failing required checks.
6. **Code review.** Address review feedback — including automated
   reviewers (e.g. Copilot). For each inline comment you act on,
   push the fix, reply on the thread noting what changed, and
   resolve the thread. Re-run CI after any fixup commit.
7. **Merge & clean up.** Once CI is green and all conversations are
   resolved, merge with `gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch`, then
   return to `main`, `git pull --ff-only`, and delete the local
   branch.

One PR per logical unit of work. Keep unrelated changes on separate
branches/PRs so each diff reviews cleanly.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) — write the test first

Every behaviour change ships with a test, and the test is written
**before** the production code. This applies to bug fixes, new
features, refactors that change observable behaviour, and
parameterization/modernization passes — anything that isn't pure
formatting.

The cycle is **red → green → refactor**:

1. **RED.** Write the smallest test that captures the next desired
   behaviour (or, for a bug, reproduces the bug). Run it. It MUST
   fail for the right reason — wrong assertion, missing symbol,
   wrong value — not because the harness mis-loaded.
2. **GREEN.** Write the minimum production code to make that test
   pass. Resist the urge to write code the failing test doesn't
   demand.
3. **REFACTOR.** Tidy the production code and/or the test while
   keeping the suite green. Run the affected suite again at the
   end.

The test and the code that satisfies it land in the **same commit**.
The commit message names what the test covers (e.g.
`fix(reducer): clear popularLoading when SetPopular dispatches with
empty results — covered by peopleReducerSetPopularClearsLoadingOnEmpty`).

This applies to every `fix:`, `feat:`, and `refactor:` commit —
reducer changes, view logic, navigation, focus handling, parsing,
test-helper rewrites, anything that crosses an assertion boundary.

### Where tests live

- **Redux reducers & state selectors:** `MovieSwift/MovieSwiftTests/`
  (see `MovieDetailStateTests.swift`, `PeopleActionsTests.swift`,
  `MovieSwiftTests.swift`).
- **UI flows / smoke tests:** `MovieSwift/MovieSwiftTests/MovieSwiftUITests`
  (macOS uses env var `UI_TEST_SELECT_MENU` to pre-select the sidebar).
- **Swift packages:** `MovieSwift/Packages/<Name>/Tests/`.

### How to run tests

```
cd MovieSwift
xcodebuild test -scheme MovieSwift \
    -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
    -only-testing:MovieSwiftTests/<TestClassName>
```

For macOS-only logic, use `-scheme MovieSwiftMac` with a macOS
destination.

### When a pure test is impractical

If a fix can only be verified visually (layout, animation, focus
ring), still note that in the commit message and add at least a
structural assertion (e.g. view builds without crashing, the
relevant accessibility identifier is present) where possible. The
TDD cycle still applies — the failing test is the structural
assertion before the visual fix lands.

## Lint & format before every commit

Run the project's linter and formatter before staging changes. CI
runs `./scripts/lint.sh` on every PR (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`),
which executes `swiftlint lint --strict` — so the canonical way to
match CI locally is `./scripts/lint.sh` (not bare `swiftlint`).
Catching violations locally avoids a forced fixup commit + extra CI
cycle.

Before `git commit`:

```bash
# Format the files you touched, or run `./scripts/format.sh` to
# format the whole `MovieSwift/` tree — `.swiftformat` is
# preserve-heavy (`--wraparguments preserve`, `--wrapcollections
# preserve`, etc.) precisely so tree-wide runs don't reflow
# unrelated files.
swiftformat path/to/ChangedFile.swift path/to/OtherChanged.swift

# Lint the whole repo. `--fix` auto-applies SwiftLint's correctable
# rules (trailing whitespace, colon/comma spacing, redundant void
# return, trailing newline) and THEN re-runs `swiftlint lint --strict`
# to surface anything autocorrect couldn't fix — same exit semantics
# as CI.
./scripts/lint.sh --fix
```

The scripts do more than just wire in flags, and there is a parallel
wrapper for SwiftFormat:

```bash
./scripts/format.sh           # rewrite every file under MovieSwift/ in place
./scripts/format.sh --check   # lint-only; non-zero exit if anything would change
./scripts/lint.sh --fix       # swiftlint --fix, THEN swiftlint lint --strict
```

Running bare `swiftlint --fix` only applies auto-corrections; it does
**not** re-lint, so non-auto-correctable violations — the exact
failures CI's strict pass will catch — go undetected locally.
`./scripts/lint.sh --fix` performs that second verification pass for
you. `format.sh` is a thin wrapper around `swiftformat MovieSwift`
that adds the `--check` mode and an install-guard.

### Exemptions: two-tier policy

Codebase-wide patterns (SwiftUI multi-trailing-closure builders,
long view bodies, TMDB snake_case field names, reducer-pattern
cyclomatic complexity) are already relaxed in `.swiftlint.yml` —
see the header comment there for the rationale on each tuned
threshold. Don't add new global relaxations without a similar note.

For one-off outliers (font-name factories that legitimately need
long identifier strings, the TMDB-schema struct name kept for
backwards compatibility, the single `MoviesReducer` switch that
exceeds even the project's already-raised `cyclomatic_complexity`
threshold), use an inline `// swiftlint:disable:next <rule>`
annotation with a one-line reason so the exception is documented at
the offending site.

## No file-header boilerplate

New `.swift` files must NOT include the Xcode-template file header
block — i.e. the lines that look like:

```
//
//  Foo.swift
//  MovieSwift
//
//  Created by Person on Date.
//  Copyright © Year Person. All rights reserved.
//
```

The project's `MovieSwift.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/IDETemplateMacros.plist`
sets `FILEHEADER` to empty so Xcode's templates don't add it. When
creating files outside Xcode (or via a Claude tool), start the file
directly at the first `import` statement. If you need to leave a
design note at the top, write it as ordinary `//` comments — but
don't include filename, project name, author, or copyright lines.
